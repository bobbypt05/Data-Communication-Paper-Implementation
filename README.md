**Abstract:**

In the era of digitalization, the online healthcare services play the vital role. Such healthcare services use Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), which is a set of independent nodes that are situated in tissues on the human body, or in the clothes. WBAN monitors human physiological signs and transmits sick vital signs to medical database using bio signals. The accuracy in bio signal transmission is important. Generally bio signal transmission uses the NRZ-I digital to digital encoding method. But NRZ-I signal contains DC component. This DC component causes the synchronization problem at the transmitter and receiver of the bio signal. For solving the synchronization problem (Clock loses) between transmitter and receiver also for inappropriate DC component in NRZ-I encoding, modified NRZ-I (MNRZ-I) method is proposed. This MNRZ-I method improves DC component up to 75%, which in turn reduces the synchronization problem. This increases the accuracy in bio signal transmission. 


**Objectives:**

* To represent the NRZ-I and MNRZ-I plot for the given sequence     	of input bit stream.  
* To show the plot of comparison of Average DC Component 	between NRZ-I and MNRZ-I.
